# Board initialization

This minimal ESP-IDF 6.1 consumer initializes LCD, touch and backlight through
Board Manager. It does not draw a GUI or initialize audio/SD. Shared SPI
boards acquire resources per device; do not replace this sequence with a
bulk `esp_board_manager_init()` call.

Install ESP-IDF 6.1 with the recommended
[ESP-IDF Installation Manager (EIM)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/idf-im-ui/en/latest/).
Activate the environment in each new terminal. For Bash/Zsh:

```bash
source ~/.espressif/tools/activate_idf_v6.1.sh
```

For Fish:

```fish
source ~/.espressif/tools/activate_idf_v6.1.fish
```

After activation, ESP-IDF trusts the `espressif/esp_board_manager` extension
downloaded from the ESP Component Registry. This workflow does not require
setting `IDF_EXTENSION_ALLOW_UNTRUSTED` manually to use `bmgr`.

The manifest uses `guition/guition_boards` 0.2.1 through
`override_path: "../../.."`. Run from this example directory:

```shell
idf.py set-target esp32p4
idf.py bmgr -b jc8012p4a1
idf.py menuconfig
idf.py build
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

Replace `PORT` with your device's serial port.

JC8012P4A1C also needs the published `guition/esp_lcd_touch_gsl3680` 0.1.0.
The touch driver is downloaded from the registry without a local override.
When copying this example elsewhere, update the board component override to
its local path, or remove it after `guition/guition_boards` is published.

For another board choose its matching target and BMGR identifier from
`board_catalog.json` (use `bmgr_board` when supplied). For example,
`esp32_2432s024` uses target `esp32`. ESP32 and ESP32-C3 have no PSRAM.
Run menuconfig to choose the available touch variant; currently the existing
P4 boards retain their native touch configuration and have no C/R/N menu.

When changing IDF versions or chips, clear this example's previous build
and `components/gen_bmgr_codes` before `set-target`, then regenerate with
`bmgr`. Never reuse a board's generated configuration for a different chip.
The bundled partition table fits the supported boards' minimum 4 MB flash;
adjust it for your application if necessary. Older ESP32-P4 silicon requires
the matching revision-family settings in menuconfig. Compilation is not
a hardware test.
